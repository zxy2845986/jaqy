.filter
-------

``.filter`` does client side ResultSet filtering using predicates.

If `.limit <limit.html>`__ is used, then the filtering is only applied to the
rows retrieved.

The filtering predicates are removed after being used.

Syntax
~~~~~~

The syntax is basically similar to WHERE clause.

Besides the usual ``AND``, ``OR``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``=``, ``>=``, ``>``
operators.  The following operators are also supported.

* ``BETWEEN <num> AND <num>``
* ``< ANY ( ... )``, ``< SOME ( ... )``, ``< ALL ( ... )`` etc
* ``IN ( ... )``
* ``LIKE 'regex'``.  The regex here is in JavaScript syntax.

JavaScript function calls are supported as well.

Example
~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: text

	.filter a > 10 AND b < 100
	SELECT * FROM MyTable ORDER BY a;
