.project
--------

``.project`` does client side ResultSet projection.

If `.limit <limit.html>`__ is used, then the projection is only applied to the
rows retrieved.

Syntax
~~~~~~

The syntax is basically similar to SELECT clause, but only simple column
names and ``AS`` clause is supported.

It should be noted that ``"`` is always used to quote column names.

Example
~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: text

	.project a AS "Column 1", b
	SELECT * FROM MyTable ORDER BY a;
