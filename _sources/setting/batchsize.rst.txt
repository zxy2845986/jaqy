batchsize
---------

``batchsize`` setting sets the data batch loading size.

This is a session setting.

By default, the batchsize is 5000.

Too large of batch size consumes too much memory, while too small of batch size
can significantly reduce the loading performance.  A good value is the one
that gets the most out of the loading performance without consuming a lot of
memory.

Depending on the row size (i.e. how big a single row of data to be transmitted
in bytes), 5000 is a fairly good value.  On extremely large rows, you may want
to reduce this value.

Syntax
~~~~~~

.. code-block:: text

	usage: .set batchsize [size]

Without the size arguments, it displays the current session's batch size.

If the batch size is 1, batch mode is disabled.

Example
~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: sql

	-- Disable batch mode
	.set batchsize 1
	.import csv -h on batch.csv
	INSERT INTO MyTable VALUES (?, ?);


	-- Large batch
	.set batchsize 10000
	.import csv -h on batch.csv
	INSERT INTO MyTable VALUES (?, ?);
